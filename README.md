# End2End_ML_Workflow
Overview

This project builds a complete machine learning workflow to predict home sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a productionalizable ML pipeline—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation and deployment readiness.

This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to:
-Conduct rigorous data analysis and predictive modeling.
-Design a modular, reusable ML pipeline suitable for production.
-Communicate results effectively through visualizations and documentation.

After completing this project, the same workflow will be adapted to recent local housing data (e.g., MLS or public listings) for applied, real-world prediction.

Objectives
Analytical Objectives
-Explore and understand the relationships between home features and sale prices.
-Engineer features and preprocess data for optimal model performance.
-Build, tune, and evaluate multiple regression models to predict SalePrice.
-Interpret the model’s predictions to identify key drivers of housing value.

Engineering Objectives
-Implement a modular end-to-end pipeline that automates:
--Data ingestion
--Cleaning and transformation
--Model training and evaluation
-Enable reproducibility through code modularization and environment files.
-Prepare the model for deployment via serialization (e.g., joblib) and optional API serving.

Dataset
Source: Ames Housing Dataset on Kaggle
Description: The dataset includes detailed attributes for residential homes sold in Ames, Iowa, between 2006 and 2010.
Target variable: SalePrice (continuous numeric variable)
Features: 80+ attributes, including lot size, square footage, number of rooms, construction quality, neighborhood, and more.
